                    I am currently 19 years old, I am attending the College for Software Engineering in Perg and graduating this year. After my graduation I will have to do the six months millitary service for Austria.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, I am very interested in technology, therefore, I am attending developer conferences in my freetime (visited DevOne 2018, WeAreDeveloper AI Congress 2018, WeAreDeveloper Worldcongress 2018, Global Azure Bootcamp 2018 and some smaller conferences like Technologieplauscherl in Linz). In addition I like topics like AI, ML and cryptocurrencies (especially IOTA). 
                    <br><br><br>
                    I am open to new oppertunities for working a few months abroad, to see the world and to meet great people.

                    During my education in the College for Software Engineering in Perg, we learend programming, but we also got in touch with databases, networkmanagement and accounting. <br><br>
                    In the first and second year we learned the fundamentals of programming in Java. We also had a glimpse into C. 
                    <br>
                    In the third year we got in touch with databases (the focus was on the Oracle Database) and on some programming frameworks.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    C# was the programming language, which we learned in the fourth and five year.
                    <br>
                    We also had Mobile Computing were we learned Angular 6.0 in deep and also the basics of Android and Objective C.
